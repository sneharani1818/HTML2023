#include <stdio.h>: is a header file which let us work with predefined functions such as printf()
printf(): a predefined function used to display output on screen

Rules for identifiers or naming functions:
1. Each name must be unique
2. Can be short or descriptive; x, age...
3. Can contain letters, digits, and underscore
4. Can begin with letter or underscore
5. Case sensitive
6. Cannot contain any other special character
7. Keywords/reserved words cannot be used as identifiers

Displaying decimal digits acc to our precision: printf("%.2f",x); This will print upto 2 decimal precision.
