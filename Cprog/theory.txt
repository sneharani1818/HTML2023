#include <stdio.h>: is a header file which let us work with predefined functions such as printf()
printf(): a predefined function used to display output on screen

Rules for identifiers or naming functions:
1. Each name must be unique
2. Can be short or descriptive; x, age...
3. Can contain letters, digits, and underscore
4. Can begin with letter or underscore
5. Case sensitive
6. Cannot contain any other special character
7. Keywords/reserved words cannot be used as identifiers

Displaying decimal digits acc to our precision: printf("%.2f",x); This will print upto 2 decimal precision.

Constants can be declared by using const keyword.. const int PI=3.14;
While declaring constants, its value must be given at the time of declaration.

Operators: Arithmetic, Logical,Short-hand, Comparison, sizeof
sizeof: tells the memory size in bytes, of a data type
To print size, we use %lu instead of %d. This is because compiler expects sizeof to return long unsigned integer

bool data type: #include <stdbool.h>
It can take any numerical values, true or false. Only 0 is false. Rest int are true/1.
